CBM

Figurative language processed as literal language, but:
1. very familiar idioms are stored as units. 
2. the figurative interpretation of an idiom can be activated before the expression has reached its end.
3. the compositional and non-compositional meanings of the string may interact.

- Conventionality
- Frequency
- Prototypicality
- Familiarity

SEMANTIC ANTICIPATION

- Gender (Huettig & Janse, 2016)
- Tense (Altmann & Kamide, 2007)
- Stereotypical constraints (Kamide, Altmann & Haywood, 2003)
- Nouns based on frequent context (DeLong, Urbach and Kutas, 2005; Nieuwland et al., 2017)

# 2. My study

### Can L1 and L2 speakers of Spanish (proficient speakers and interpreters) predict figurative language based on the first lexical item of the expression?

# 2. My study

## Prediction and Hypothesis

L1 speakers anticipate figurative expressions but not literal based on the first lexical element. </br>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If speakers can anticipate it, the collocation is stored as multi-word unit.      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If speakers cannot anticipate it, the collocation is not stored as a holistic unit.

### Growth Curve Analysis Plot

# 5. Discussion

- No group was able to anticipate given the adjusted alpha level, although monolinguals showed a tendency.

- Both groups fixated more on the correct target words in figurative trials than literal trials.

- Lexical cues did not work as such, unless figurative language takes longer to be processed (Boulenger et al., 2012; Kutas & Federmeier, 2000, 2011).

- OVER TIME?? (Waiting for GCA)

- Constraint-Based Model (Libben & Titone, 2008): not enough evidence to support holistic storage.

- Literal Saliency Hypothesis (Cieślicka, 2006): supported, but L1 against.

---

# 6. Future directions

- Larger pool of expressions + other factors involved: Cross-linguistic effects, meaning transparency...

- Turning point between L1 and L2 speakers? -> Heritage speakers

---

# 7. Conclusion

- Lagging L2 figurative language performance may stem from storage.     

- Other factors need consideration for a full picture.

- Should we teach figurative expressions differently?
